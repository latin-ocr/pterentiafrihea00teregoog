GENERAL INTRODUCI'ION.

MENEDEMUS, the “sels-tormentor,” is a citizen of Atheus, whose only son CL1N1A fell
in love with Aurnnnn. Munnnnvns bitterly opposed his son’s marriage lo a portionless
stranger, and by his harshness and taunts finally drove him to leave home and go to the
wars in Asia. After he had gone, Msrvsnsnus was filled with remorse. He sold his
estete in Athens and moved to the country, where we find him punishing himself hy
laboring incessantly, and living a life of extreme frugality. CLINIA has returned, unknown
to his father, and is staying with an intimate friend, Cn'nnno, whose father, Cunnuns,
is Munununws's next door neighbor in the country. The details of the plot are given
in the introductione at the beginning of each scene.

CHREMES asks Munununws why, though an old man, and evidently well to do, he wears
himself out by working from morning till night. MENEDEMUS at first returns short

answers, but finally tells his story, and explains that he is punishing himself for his
cruelty to his sou.
