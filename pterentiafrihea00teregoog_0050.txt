retum. Stltus teiln CHREMES that Cntnln is making his father believe that Bnccttts
iscnmfflo’s mistress, while he himself pretends to be in love with ANT1P111LA, hoping
to get money dut of his father for wedding expenses. Svnus advises Cnnsmsss to
ieign consent to the meninge oi cunin and Anntnmnn. He refuses, but consents to
pay Bnccffls a sum of money'nhich Snnus pretends is due her from Anninfflnn’s

tress, sends it to her by his son’s hand.
