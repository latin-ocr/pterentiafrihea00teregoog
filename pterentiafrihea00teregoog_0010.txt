PREFACE.

Tun general planos this little book, which it is hoped may he found
useful ior sight reading, was suggested by Mn. Pnnuun's “Ansmnosss’

The text is that oi C. tharzxo (Leipzig, 1884), with some unimportant
changes in punctuation.

In some ol the stage directions I have ventured, ior the sake ol viv-
idness‚ to indicate gestures which a modern actor would use under the
circumstances, although we have no evidence sor believing that a Roman
actor would have expressed himself in the same way.

I am under great obligations to Pnon. qucts W. Kmsnu ol the
Umvmsm on M1cn1cau, and Mn. ,Fuluii W. Nicomou, Instructor in

Hanvann Umvmsm, who have read the prools, and given me many
valuable suggestions.
